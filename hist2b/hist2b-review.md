### The Epidemic Disease

> What role did epidemic disease (i.e., the Black Death and small pox epidemics) play in world history? What sorts of impact (both positive and negative) did these epidemics have on the societies affected?

The Black Death

- Originated in Inner Asia. 25 to 65 percent death rate.
- **Little Ice Age** may have weakened populations and left them with vulnerable to disease.
    - Harsh winters and rainy summers shortened the growing season and ruined harvests, which later caused famine across Europe.
    - The spread of the plague occurred in East Asia. Rodents were forced to move, hence began the migration of microbes.
- What spread the germs across Afro-Eurasia was the **Mongol's trading network**. 
    - All routes from southwestern China terminated at the Italian port cities, where ships with dead and dying men aboard arrived.
- Many believed that **God was angry with humankind**.
    - One Florentine historian compared the plague to the biblical Flood and believed that the end of humankind was imminent.
- Plague in China.
    - By 1300, hunger and scarcity began to spread as resources stretched thin. The Black Death ravaged China and shattered the Mongol's claim to a mandate from heaven.
    - The reign of the last Yuan Mongol rulers was a time of utter chaos. Bandit groups and dissidents religious sects were undercutting the state's power.
- Plague in the Islamic world.
    - The plague devasted parts of the Muslim world as well. Ibn Khaldun lost his mother, father, and a number of his teachers to the Black Death in Tunis. He wrote, "The entire world changed."
    - The devastation of the Black Death followed hard on the heels of the Mongol destruction of Islam's world. The two catastrophes prepared the way for new Islamic states to emerge. Persian and Turkish political force became Islam's most effective rulers. The Ottomans, the Safavids, and the Mughals emerged as the dominant states in the Islamic world in the early 16th century.
- Plague in Europe.
    - The overcrowded and unsanitary cities were particularly vulnerable. Not only the poor, but also the privileges died. Nearly two-thirds of Europe's total population perished.
    - After 1353, the epidemic subsided, having killing all those with no natural immunity and most of the original carriers of the disease, the European black rat. But it would return every seven years or so for the following two centuries. It took three centuries to return to population levels that existed prior to the Black Death.
- The **cultura, enconmic, and political influence**.
    - Many individuals turned to pleasure, even debauchery, determined to enjoy themselves before it came their turn to die. Characteristic of the period was a new intensity of private piety.
    - When farmers fell ill or died with the plague, food production collapsed. Famines ensued and killed off survivors.
    - The shortages of food led to rapidly rising prices, hoarding, work stoppages, and unrest. Political leaders added to their unpopularity by repressing the unrest.

Rebuilding states.

- Starting in the late fourteenth century, Afro-Eurasians began the task of reconstructing both their political order and their trading networks.
- Rulers needed to revive confidence in themselves and their political systems, which they did by forstering beliefs and rituals that confirmed their legitimacy adn by increasing their control over subjects.
- The form the power took in most places was the **dynasty**, the hereditary ruling family that passed control from one generation to the next.
    1. First, they insisted that their power derived from a divine calling, the *mandate of heaven* or *divine right*.
    2. Leaders squelched squabbling among potential heirs by establishing clear rules about succession to the throne.
    3. Ruling families elevated their power through conquest or alliance.
- The innovative state building that occurred in the wake of the plague's devastation would not have been as successful had it not drawn on older traditions.

Western Christendom

- The Black Death raised questions about God's relationship to humankind and the Catholic Church's role as God's appointed mediator on earth.
    - The Church responded by demanding strict obedience to the true faith, entailing the persecution of heretics. But the Church also reacted to society's suffering during this period, expanding its charitable and bureaucratic functions. Its responses reassured many that God, and the church, had not abandoned true Christians and shored up the power of religious authorities.

Smallpox

- Amerindian populations, in their world apart, had no immunity for Eurasian diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and cholera. In a few short decades following their first contact with Europeans, these groups suffered a catastrophic decline.
    - More than any other factor, the spread of the *Old World* diseases allowed Europeans to conquer and colonize vast swaths of the Americas. 
 
### Portuguese voyages of exploration

 > What sort of impact did Portuguese voyages of exploration have on the Indian Ocean basin?

- The Muslim conquest of Constantinople and the Ottoman expansion into the Mediterranean sent shock waves through Christendom and prompted Europeans to probe unexplored links to the east.
- Europeans had long believed that Africa was a storehouse of precious metals. 
- Innovations in maritime technology and information from Arab mariners and ancient Greek texts helped Portuguese sailors navigated the trecherous waters along the African coast. 
- Africa and the islands along its coast soon proved to befar more than a stop-off en route to India or a source of precious metals. Africa became a valued trading area, and its islands were prime locations for growing sugarcane.
    - In the 1400s, these new islands saw the beginnings of a system of plantation agriculture built on slavery that would travel across the Atlantic in the following century.
- In Asia, Portugal never wanted to rule directly or to establish colonies. Rather, its seaborne empire adapted to local circumstances in order to exploit Asian commercial networks and trading systems.
    - The first Portuguese mariner to reach the Indian Ocean was Vasco da Gama. 
- To the Portuguese, who traded in the name of their crown, commercial access was worth fighting for. Da Gama had proved the feasibility and profitability of trade via the Indian Ocean.
- The Portuguese repeated their show of force in strategic locations, especially the three naval choke points: Aden, Hormuz, and Melaka. Once established in key ports, the Portuguese attempted to take over the trade or, failing this, to tax local merchants.
- The Portuguese did not seek to interrupt the flow of luxuries among Asian and African elites in the Idian Ocean; rather, their captains simply kept a portion of the profits for themselves.
    - They indroduced a pass system that required ships to pay for **cartazes**, documents identifying the ship's captain, size of the sip and crew, and its cargo.
    - They were also active in the spice trade, and Lisbon gradually eclipsed Italian ports for Asian goods.

### The dimise of the Aztec Empire

> What prompted the demise of the Aztec Empire?

- Amerindian populations, in their world apart, had no immunity for Eurasian diseases such as smallpox, typhus, and cholera. In a few short decades following their first contact with Europeans, these groups suffered a catastrophic decline.
    - More than any other factor, the spread of the *Old World* diseases allowed Europeans to conquer and colonize vast swaths of the Americas. 
- In pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and then the Andes, warfare was more ceremonial, less inclined to wipe out enemies than to make them tributary subjects. As a result, the wealth of these empires made them irresistible to outside conquerors, whose habits of war they could never have forseen.
- Aztec power spread through much of Mesoamerica, but the empire's constant wars and conquests deprived it of stability.
    - Those whome the Aztecs sought to dominate did not submit peacefully. The empire faced constant turmoil as subject people resented Aztec domination, and independent peoples to preserve their independentce.
- Crucial to Spanish conquest was their alliance, negotiated through translators, with Moctezuma's enemies, especially the Tlaxcalans.
- The Spaniards' second advantage was their method of warfare.
    - The Aztecs were seasond fighters, but they fought to capture, not to kill. Nor they familiar with gunpowder or sharp stell swords.

### The Spanish conquest of the New World

> How does the story of Doña Marina illustrate the character of the Spanish *conquest* of the New World?

The Columbus's voyage and first conquests

- The term *New World*, as applied to the Americas, reflects the European's view that anything previously unknown to them as *new*, even if it had existed and supported societies long before European explorers arrived on its shores.
- For Columbus, the Taino's naivety in grabbing his sword symbolized the childlike primitiveism of these people, whom he would mislabel *Indians* because he thought he had arrived off the coast of Asia. In Columbus's view, the Tainos had no religion, but they did have at least some gold.
- In due course, the Indians realized that the strange, hairy people bearing metal weapons meant to stay and force the Amerindian population to labor for them. But by then it was too late. The explorers had become conquistadors.
- Then years later the Spanish outfitted an expedition with 2500 men. Exploration now yielded to warfare and exploitation.
- Dissent and debate would be a permanent feature of Spanish colonialism in the New World.

### Africans in the Atlantic world

> What role did Africans play in the making of the Atlantic world?

- As European demand for sugar increased, the slave trade expanded.
    - More than five times as many Africans as Europeans moved to the Amricas.
    - Trade in slaves grew steadily throughtout the sixtenth century, then surged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. All maor European powers participated in human cargo, establishing direct trade links with Africa.
- Well before European merchants arrived off its western coast, Africa had known long-distance slave trading.
    - The overall number of Africas sold into captivity in the Muslim world exceeded that of the Atlantic slave trade.
    - Africans maintained slaves themselves, too.
- The overwhelming trend was to further limit Africa's population. Indeed, African laborers fetched high enough prices to more than cover the costs of their capture and transportation across the Atlantic.
- The Atlantic system was established by the late sixteenth century, with Africa supplying labor, the Americas land and minerals, and Europeans the technology and military power to hold the system together.
- The gender imbalance made it difficult for slaves to reproduce in the Americas. So planters and slavers had to return to Africa to procure more captives.
- In some parts of Arica, the booming slave trade wreaked havoc as local leaders feuded over control of the traffic; mercantilist rivalry along the African coast disrupted old staets and produced new ones.
- Slavery and the emergence of new political organizations enriched and empowered some Africans, but they cost Africa dearly.
    - For the princes, warriors, and merchants who organized the slave trade, their business enabled them to obtain European goods. The Atlantic system also tilted wealth away from rural dwellers and village elders and increasingly toward port cities.
    - The slave trade enriched African upper classes who sold their captives to European slavers and used their wealth to fund cultural activities and invigorate centuries-old artisanal and artistic traditions. Artisans and craftspersons drew on their own traditions.

### European missionaries

> What role did western European missionaries play in promoting cross-cultural dialogue and interaction?

- Europe's new science and enlightened thought arose in reaction both to Europe's expanding interaction with the rest of the world and to the period's environmental, religious, and political chaos.
    - In the Islamic world, occasional scholars were able to challenge the ulma's monopoly on learning and to look outward for inspiration, but such efforts relied on reformist patrons, who were not in great abundance.
    - China's science suffered a fundamental disadvantage compared with Europe's. It was practical and empirical rather than theoretical. Its practitioners were less inclined to mathematize the study of the natural world. Nor did they fully understand the use of the experimental method; and unlike European's scientists, who forstered a mathematical and mechanistic view of the natural world, they sall all of life and nature organically.
- Starting in the late sixteenth century, Jesuit missionaries found Chinese literati and the offical classes extraordinarily receptive to European breakthroughs in astronomy and mathematics.
- The two first Jesuit missionaries to reach China.
    - Michele Ruggieri (罗明坚) arrived in 1582.
    - Matteo Ricci (利玛窦) arrived in 1583.
    - They both were brilliantly educated not just in religious and theological matters but in Europe's evolving new science.
- The Chinese officials were eager to employ Jesuit knowledge of mathematics and astronomy to assist them in bringing ceremonial dates and political and economic activities into a better relationship with the seasons.
    - But the Chinese did not accept their religious and theological tenets, and the men made only a very small number of converts.

## Long essay

### Mongol Conquest vs. Voyages of Zheng He

> What (in the estimate of world historians) do the Mongol Conquests have in common with the voyages of Zheng He?

Mongol Conquest


The expeditions of Zheng He

- One spectacular exception to the Ming's attitude toward maritime trade was a series of officially sponsored expeditions in the early fifteenth century.
    - It was the ambitious Yongle Emperor who took the initative.
    - One of his loyal followers was a Muslim whom the Ming army had captured as a boy. The youth was castrated and sent to serve at the court, given the name Zheng He.
    - The emperor entrusted him with venturing out to trade, collect tribute, and display China's power to the world.
- Zheng He commanded the world's greatest armada and led seven naval expeditions. ALl 28000 men aboard pledged to promote Ming glory.
- Zheng He and his entourage aimed to establish trib utary relations with far-flung territories, from Southeast Asia to the Indian Ocean ports, to the Persian Gulf, and to the east coast of Africa.
    - These expeditions did not seek territorial expansion, but rather control of trade and tribute.
    - If a community refused to pay tribute, Zheng's fleet would attack it.

### Columbian Exchange vs. Chenghis Exhange

> How did the Columbian Exchange compare with the Chenghis Exhange?

Columbian exchange

- Those who came to the Americas carried devastating diseases that killed tens of millions of Amerindians. The newcomers also brought horses, cattle, pigs, wheat, grapvines, and sugarcane. In exchange, then learned about crops such as potates and corn that would fuel a population explosion across Afro-Eurasia.
    - Over the time, these transfers would change the demography and the diets of both the New and the Old Worlds.
- The first and most profound effect of the Columbian exchange was a destructive one: the decimation of the Amerindian population by European diseases.
    - Sickness spread from almost the moment the Spaniards arrived.
    - Imported pathogens wiped out up to 90 percent of the Amerindian population. A century after smallpox arrived on Hispaniola, no more than 5 to 10 percent of the island's population were left.
- As time passed, all sides adopted new forms of agriculture from one another.
    - The Chinese found that they could grow corn in areas too dry for rice and too wet for wheat.
    - Corn also replaced Africa's major food.
    - Europeans also took away tomatos, beans, cacao, peanuts, tobacco, and squash, while exporting livestock such as cattle, swine, and horses to the New World.
- As Europeans cleared trees and other vegetation for rancehs, mines, or plantations, they undermined the habitats of many indigenous manmals and birds. 

Chenghis exchange

- The Mongols not only conquered but also intensified trade and cultural exchange. By consolidating a latticework of states (known as khanates) across northern and central Asia, they created an empire as other dynasties.
- Mongol tribes solidified their conquests by extanding kinship networks, building an empire out of an expanding confederation of familial tribes.
- Afro-Eurasian regions were connected by land and by sea in historically unparalleled ways.
- In the thirteenth century, Mongol tribesmen streamed out of the steppes, crossing the whole of Asia and entering the eastern parts of Europe. Möngke Khan, a grandson of Chinggis, made clear the Mongol aspiration for world domination:
    - he appointed his brother Kubilai to rule over China, Tibet, and the northern parts of India;
    - and he commanded another brother, Hulagu, to conquer Iran, Syria, Egypt, Byzantium, and Armenia.
- They were better at conquering than governing. In China and Persia, Mongol rule collapsed in the fourteenth century.
- Mongol conquest reshaped Afro-Eurasia's social landscape.
    - Islam would never again have a unifying authority like the caliphate or a powerful center like Baghdad. 
    - China was divided and changed. The Mongols introduces Persian, Islamic, and Byzantine influences on China's architecture, art, science, and medicine. The Yuan policy of benign tolerance also brought elements from Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam into the Chinese mix. The Mongol thrust led to a great opening, as fine goods, traders, and technology flowed from China to the rest of the world in ensuing centuries.
    - The Mongol conquests, somewhat like those of Alexander the Great in an earlier age, encouraged an Afro-Eurasian interconnectedness, but on a scale that the huge landmass had not known before and would not experience again for hundreds of years.
    - Out of conquest and warfare would come centuries of trade, migrations, and increasing contact between Africa, Europe, and Asia.

### Islamization in Africa vs. Christianzation

> Compare and contrast the process of Islamization in Africa with the process of Christianzation.

## Additional

### Tokugawa japan

- In Japan, a single ruling family emerged. This dynastic state, the Tokugawa shogunate, accomplished something that most of the world's other regimes did not: it regulated foreign intrusion.
- Regional ruiling families, called daimyos, had commanded private armies of warriors known as samurai. They sometimes brought order to their domains, but no one family could establish preemience over other.
- Tokugawa Ieyasu was one of Toyotomi's daimyos. After his death, Ieyasu seized power. Later he assumed the title of shogun, retaining the emperor in name only while taking the reins of power himself. The hereditary Tokugawa shogunate lasted for two near three centuries.
    - Japan was under peace during this period.
- Internal peace and prosperity did not insulate Japan from external challenges, especially the intrusion of Christian missionaries and European traders.
    - The shogunate restricted Europeans to trade only in ports under Edo'ss direct rule in Honshū.
    - These measures did not close Tokugawa Japan to the outside world, however. Trade with China and Korea flourished.

### The demise of Ming and Tokugawa Japan

- The Little Ice Age was not wholly responsible for the fall of the Ming, but it played a predominant role.

### Culture and politics in East Asia

China: The challenge of expansion and diversity

- In China, the circulation of books spread ideas among the literate, and religious rituals instilled cultural values among the broader population. Advances in cartography reflected the distinctive worldview of Chinese elites.
    - There was no centralized system of censor ship, and unauthorized opinions circulated freely.
    - By the late Ming era, a burgeoning publishing sector to the diverse social, cultural, and religious needs of educated elites and urban populations.
- Before the nineteenth century, the Chinese had incomplete knowledge about foreign lands despite a long hisory of contact.
    - The empire saw itself as superior to all others.
    - During this period of cultural flourishing, in short, most Chinese did not feel compelled to revise their view of the world.

Cultural identity nd Tokugawa Japan

- Tokugawa engaged in a three-cornered conversation that included time-honored Chinese ways, European teachings, and distinctly Japanese traditions.
- As European knowledge spread to high circles in Edo, in 1720 the shogunate lifted its ban on foreign books. Thereafter, European ideas, called *Dutch leanring*, circulated more openly.
- By the eighteenth century, though, expanded networks of exchange and new prosperity made the integration of foreign ideas feasible and, sometimes, desirable.
    - This was not the case for the great Asian land-based empires, which were eager lenders but hesitant borrowers.
