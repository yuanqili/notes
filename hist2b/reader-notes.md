## Medieval Trade Routes and Cultural Crossroads

### Letters of Medieval Jewish Traders

- Because of the general insecurity and the slowness of communications, international trade was largely dependent on personal relationships and mutal confidence.
- Religion was conducive not only to the formation of business relationships, but also to their proper conduct. The continuous references to God in the Cairo Geniza is not a mere *façon de parler*.
- The twin city Cairo-Fustat, the capital of Egypt, formed the terminal for both the Mediterranean and the India trade and served as distribution center for the goods of both.
    - The India trade was an extension and a branch of the commerce uniting the countries of the Mediterranean. Over one-half of the commodities traded on the Mediterranean market, especially spices, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, dyeing stuffs, and certain textiles, were imported from India and the Far East.
    - Western goods were inferior; their gold and silver were constantly flowing to the East. Silk was also a replacement for gold.
- A voyage to India necessitated an absence of two years at least, but often of many more, due to shipwrecks, pirates, or etc. 
- There was also a relatively mature judicial system. 

### A Dream of Splendors Past (东京梦华录) by Yuanlao Meng (孟元老)

> 繁华如此，何以倾覆？繁华至此，自当倾覆。

- A text version of the Beijing Qingming Scroll (Along the River During the Qingming Festival).
- The rampant consumerism and hedonism mark life in the last years of Huizong's reign.

## The Mongols and Their Impact

### The Secret History of the Mongols

- The Mongols were illiterate before the time of Chingis Khan, who adopted the script of the Uighurs, one of the more literate peoples of the steppe. The author is unknown. It is clearly an insider's account of the early years of Mongol expansion.
- Tayang Khan's general Kokse'u Sabrakh: "You cut off the head of a dead ruler (Ong Khan), and then you trample it into the dust. What kind of behavior is this? Listen to the baying of those dogs: It has an evil sound."
- Temujin's youngest brother Temuga: "If a man allows his quivers to be taken away during his lifetime, what kind of an existence does he have? For a man who is born a man, it is a good enough end to be slain by another man, and lie on the steppe with his quiver and bow beside him."

### Al-Bakrí on West Africa

- Malal: Its people prayed for rain but the drought only increased. Once a day the king had as his guest a Muslim, who told him to convert to Islam and the situation would be changed. Thus he continued to press the king until the latter accepted Islam and became a sincere Muslim.

### Mansa Musa's pilgrimage to Mecca

### African Kingdoms and Islam

- Extensive trade ran from the Sudanic kingdoms to North Africa and the Middle East, involving exchagnes of gold, salt, some slaves, and other products in return for more manufactured goods and horses. 
- Contacts with North Africa included growing awareness of Islam. Mass conversions to Islam did not occuring in sub-Saharan Africa at this point, but there was important interaction. Many Sudanic kings used Muslims as bureaucrats, benefiting among other things from their education and literacy. Many kings of Mali and other domains converted to Islam, establishing major educational centers and in one case making an elaborate pilgrimage to Mecca.
- Still, sub-Saharan Africa did not become a full part of Islamic civilization as North Africa did. Political institutions, popular rerligion, art, and gender roles were among the features of African society that remained partly distinct.
