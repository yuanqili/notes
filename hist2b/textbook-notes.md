### Development of Maritime Trade

- By the tenth century CE, sea routes were eclipsing land networks for long-distance trade. Shapping were made easier and slashed the costs of seaborne trade with
    - improved navigational aids (the needle compass),
    - refinements in shipbuilding,
    - better mapmaking, and
    - new legal arrangements and accounting practices.
- Long-distance trade spawned the growth of commercial cities. These **entrepôts** served as transshipment centers where ships could drop anchor and merchants could find lodging, exchange commodities, and replenish supplies.
    - Egypt: Alexandria, Cairo
    - China: Quanzhou
    - Malaya: Melaka
    - Indian Penissula: Kollam
- Global commercial hubs relied on friendship and family to keep their businesses thriving across religious and regional divides. Whether in India, Melaka, China, or Egypt, each bustling port teemed with a cosmopolitan mix of peoples, goods and ideas that flowed through the growing maritime networks, thanks to improved ships and better navigational tools.

### The Origins and Spread of Islam

- Islam crossed the Sahara Desert and penetrated well into Africa, carried by traders and shcolars; there merchants exchanged weapons and textiles for gold, salt, and slaves.
    - Trade not only joined West Africa to North Africa, but also generated prodigious wealth, allowing centralized political kingdoms to develop, among which was Ghana, which lay at the terminus of North Africa's major trading routes.
    - Seafaring Muslim traders carried Islam into East Africa via the Indian Ocean. By the tenth century, the East African coast featured a mixed African-Arab culture. The region's evolving Bantu language absorbed Arbic words and before long gained a new name, Swahili (derived from the Arabic plural of the world meaning "coast").
- Muslims shared a reverence for a basic text and a single God, but often they had little else in common. 
    - The vast majority of Muslims today are **Sunnis** ("tradition"). They accept that the political succession to the Prophet through the four rightly guided caliphs and then to the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties was the correct one.
    - **Shiites** ("members of the party of Ali) felt that the proper successors should have been Ali, who had married the Prophet's daughter Fatima, and his descendants. Shittes believe that Ali's descendants, whom they call *imams*, have religious and prophetic power as well as political authority, and thus should enjoy spiritual primacy.
- After 300 years of struggling, the Shittes finally seized power. Repressed in Iraq and Iran, Shiite activists made their way to North Africa. In 909 CE, a Shiite religious and military leader, Abu Abdallah, overthrew the Sunni ruler there. Thus began the **Fatimid regime**.
    - The Fatimid rulers established their capital in a new city that arouse alongside al-Fustat, the old Umayyad capital. They called this place al-Qahira, or **Cairo**, "the Victorious". The Fatimid regime lasted until the late twelfth century.

### Sub-Saharan Africa Comes Together

- Once trade routes bridged the Sahara Desert, the flow of commodities and ideas linked sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa and Southwest Asia.
    - Mande-speaking peoples emerged as the primary agents for integration within and beyond West Africa. Exploting their expertise in commerce and political organization, the Mande edged out rivals.
- From the eleventh century to the late fifteenth century, the most vigorous businesses were those that spanned the Sahara Desert. The Mande-speaking peoples, with their far-flung commercial networks and highly dispersed populations, dominated this trade as well.
    - Salt, mined in the northern Sahel around the city of Taghaza.
    - Gold, minded within the Mande homeland and brone by camel caravans to the far northern side of the Sahara.
    - Slaves.
- The **Mali Empire** became the Mande successor state to the kingdom of Ghana.
    - **Sundiata** was the dynasty's founder, who might well have actually existed, as Ibn Khaldun referred to him by name and reported that the was "their greatest king". 
    - **Mansa Musa**, Mali's most famous sovereign, made a celebrated *hajj*, or pilgrimage to Mecca, travelling through Cairo and impressing crowds with the size of his retinue and his displays of wealth, especially many dazzling items made of gold.
- The Mali Empire boasted two of West Africa's largest cities:
    - **Jenne**, an ancient entrepôt, was a vital assembly point for caravans laden with salt, gold and slaves preparing for journeys west to the Atlantic coast and north over the Sahara.
    - **Timbuktu**, founded around 1100 CE as a seasonal camp for nomads, grew in size and importance under the patronage of various Malian kings. It was a thriving commercial and religious center famed for its two large mosques. It was also renowned for its intellectual vitality where West African Muslim scholars congregated to debate.
- Because of monsoon winds, East Africa was a logical end point for much of the Indian Ocean trade. 
    - **Swahili** peoples living along that coast becamse brokers for trade from the Arabian Peninsula, the Persian Gulf territories, and the western coast of India.
    - Merchants in the city of **Kilwa** on the coast of present-day Tanzania brought ivory, slaves, gold, and other items from the interior and shipped them to destinations around the Indian Ocean.
    - **Great Zimbabwe** stood supreme among the Shona. Built on the fortunes made from gold, its most impressive landmark was a massive elliptical building made of stone fitted so expertly that it needed no grouting. It was a center of the gold trade between the East African coastal peoples and traders sailing on the Indian Ocean.

### The Mongol Transformation of Afro-Eurasia

- The Mongols not only conquered but also intensified trade and cultural exchange. By consolidating a latticework of states (known as khanates) across northern and central Asia, they created an empire as other dynasties.
- Mongol tribes solidified their conquests by extanding kinship networks, building an empire out of an expanding confederation of familial tribes.
- Afro-Eurasian regions were connected by land and by sea in historically unparalleled ways.
- In the thirteenth century, Mongol tribesmen streamed out of the steppes, crossing the whole of Asia and entering the eastern parts of Europe. Möngke Khan, a grandson of Chinggis, made clear the Mongol aspiration for world domination:
    - he appointed his brother Kubilai to rule over China, Tibet, and the northern parts of India;
    - and he commanded another brother, Hulagu, to conquer Iran, Syria, Egypt, Byzantium, and Armenia.
- They were better at conquering than governing. In China and Persia, Mongol rule collapsed in the fourteenth century.
- Mongol conquest reshaped Afro-Eurasia's social landscape.
    - Islam would never again have a unifying authority like the caliphate or a powerful center like Baghdad. 
    - China was divided and changed. The Mongols introduces Persian, Islamic, and Byzantine influences on China's architecture, art, science, and medicine. The Yuan policy of benign tolerance also brought elements from Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam into the Chinese mix. The Mongol thrust led to a great opening, as fine goods, traders, and technology flowed from China to the rest of the world in ensuing centuries.
    - The Mongol conquests, somewhat like those of Alexander the Great in an earlier age, encouraged an Afro-Eurasian interconnectedness, but on a scale that the huge landmass had not known befoe and would not experience again for hundreds of years.
    - Out of conquest and warfare would come centuries of trade, migrations, and increasing contact between Africa, Europe, and Asia.
